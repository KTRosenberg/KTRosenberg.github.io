   <h1>Final Project Ideas</h1>
   <h2>1: fisheye camera</h2>
   -   was interested, but seems out-of-the-way for little result<br>
   <h2>2: remake the mirror game from assignment 5 but with a twist.</h2>
   -   possibly have a couple of mirrors in the z axis, the controls would be weird-- effect would be neat though<br>
   -   possibly too simplistic / easy? logic for collision already done<br>
   -   how would I create a glass effect (couldn't figure refraction) Furthermore, how would I do it<br> 
   -   with the non-constant light directions? Is this something that would<br>
   -   require passing down a value (direction of laser? How would I do this? (vLight?)<br>
   -   many unknowns...<br>
   <h2>3: much simplified star fox SNES clone, see video, skip to the middle</h2>

   -   I could play with the pseudo-3d background and making randomly-generated level pieces<br> 
   -   (or pieces specified in a text file for a level layout?),<br>
   -   collision would be simple, would be a neat display---possibly okay, would be fun to do assuming that<br>
   -   I could make a animation system (queue level pieces and translate with time, dequeue when beyond certain spot and enqueue<br>in back?).... basically a straight-away with blocky strips for a basic demo<br>
   -   Couple of questions: 
   <h3>1></h3> 
   -   How do I work around the clamping between -1 and 1 to create many more blocks extending into the background?<br>That is the only real limitation at the moment<br>
   <h3>2></h3> 
   -   How would I keep the collision detection working (I would just check each plane) if I were to change the perspective a bit to see the tops of buildings?<br>
   -   I kind of like this idea, though I admit it's not incredibly focused on graphics in particular.<br> 
   -   The graphics themselves would be intentionally minimalistic and blocky, but maybe this is okay<br>
   <br>
   May I have advice / help regarding some aspects of this / these? I would appreciate any feedback<br>
   Option 2 or 3 seem best, 2 would be "easiest" (With 2 I also have some questions regarding general key controls)
